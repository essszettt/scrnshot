screenshots for ZX Spectrum Next (dot command)

This tool can be called from BASIC to take screenshots. Screenshots are saved in BMP format.

Not for productive use at the moment - seems to work fine for default Spectrum video mode. Playing araound with z88dk functiones to optimize pixel calculations ...

=> Version 0.1.0 will be the first stable release ;-)
